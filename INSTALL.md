# Installation
Installation via this script is very simple.
The only requirements are the script, internet access, and a supported package manager.
1. Download this script and run it with Sudo. Your command should look like this:
` sudo sh ./kali-chroot.sh `
2. Supply all the info the tool asks for.
3. If the script can't find your alias file, place the generated alias in whichever location you desire.  
Simple as that! You can now use the command ` kali ` to enter your Chroot. Be sure to install some Kali metapackages first, as the default install doesn't contain anything other than the base system.  
If you have ANY issues with installation, please please please let me know. I will be more than happy to try to fix it with you.
